# Target-Driven-Visual-Navigation-with-Distributed-PPO

This repository has used AI2THOR CVPR data set. 

The original problem can be found in this Repositray - https://github.com/zfw1226/icra2017-visual-navigation

This problem was solved by A3C agents as in the paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05143

Here, I used Distributed PPO to solve the CVPR THPR data set problem

The DPPO code was originally taken from - https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow
